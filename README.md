Hi! My name is Zain Khan, and I am an Accelerated Master's student studying Robotics and CIS. 

I am currently in my 4th year of undergrad at Penn, and some of my hobbies include playing chess, weightlifting, board/card games, and reading. I am passionate about delving into the intricacies of robotics and artificial intelligence, particularly exploring advanced machine learning algorithms and their application in creating autonomous systems. I am driven by a desire to understand how these technologies can revolutionize industries, enhance human productivity, and ultimately contribute to solving some of society's most pressing challenges.
